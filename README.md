# MLPR-Lab-5
Aim
To perform face detection using OpenCV and apply K-Means clustering on facial features.

Methodology
Used Haar Cascade classifier for face detection
Converted image to HSV color space
Extracted Hue and Saturation features from detected faces
Applied K-Means clustering (k=2)
Visualized clusters using scatter plots
Classified a template image using trained model
Key Findings
Successfully detected 30 faces from the input image
Faces were grouped into 2 clusters based on color features
K-Means effectively separated faces with similar characteristics
Template image was correctly classified into one cluster
Results
Face detection worked efficiently using OpenCV
Clustering based on HSV features gave meaningful grouping
Visualization helped understand distribution of clusters
